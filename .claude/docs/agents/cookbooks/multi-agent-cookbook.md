Multiagent: coordinate a specialist team
We'll use Claude Managed Agents and the multi-agent coordinator pattern to automate sales-proposal writing for a fictional company called Northstar, which sells a workflow-automation platform to mid-market operations teams.

Right now, their reps build a tailored proposal for each prospect: research what companies in the prospect's segment typically prioritize, pull two relevant case studies from a library of a few hundred, model pricing from an internal rules sheet, and assemble it into a two-page document. Each step draws on a different source and a different kind of judgment.

We'll have a coordinator agent run three specialists to do this. A researcher uses web search to find what's typical for the prospect's segment. A librarian reads the case-study library and picks the two best matches. A pricing modeler sees only the rules file and the seat count. The coordinator sequences them and writes the proposal.


1. Set up the client
First, let's install the SDK and set up the Anthropic client. The multiagent config and event types are part of the Managed Agents beta.

python

%%capture
%pip install -q anthropic python-dotenv
python

import os
 
import anthropic
from dotenv import load_dotenv
 
load_dotenv()
 
BETAS = ["managed-agents-2026-04-01"]
MODEL = os.environ.get("COOKBOOK_MODEL", "claude-opus-4-6")
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

2. Define three specialist subagents
Next, we'll create the three teammates. Each one gets its own system prompt, its own output shape, and only the tools it needs for its job. The researcher gets web search, the case-study picker can only read the local library, and the pricing modeler just sees pricing_rules.md and the seat count. Scoping tools per role keeps the pricer from pulling a competitor's number off the web and keeps the full case-study library out of the coordinator's context.

python

def make_agent(name, description, system, tools):
    a = client.beta.agents.create(
        name=name,
        description=description,
        model=MODEL,
        system=system,
        tools=tools,
        betas=BETAS,
    )
    print(f"{name}: {a.id}")
    return a.id
 
 
prospect_researcher = make_agent(
    "prospect_researcher",
    "Researches what companies in a given industry segment and size tier typically prioritize.",
    """Given a prospect's industry and size, use web search to find:
- What companies in that segment typically list as strategic priorities
- Recent trends or pressures in that industry
- Common operational pain points at that scale
Return via send_to_parent: {"priorities": [...], "recent_moves": [...], "pain_points": [...], "sources": [...]}""",
    [
        {
            "type": "agent_toolset_20260401",
            "configs": [{"name": "web_search"}, {"name": "web_fetch"}],
        }
    ],
)
 
case_study_picker = make_agent(
    "case_study_picker",
    "Selects the two most relevant case studies from the library for a given prospect profile.",
    """The case study library is in /mnt/user-data/case_studies/. Each file is one customer story.
You will be given a prospect's industry, size, and top priorities. Read the library, score each study on relevance, and pick the two best matches.
Return via send_to_parent: {"picks": [{"file": ..., "customer": ..., "why_relevant": ...}, ...]}""",
    [{"type": "agent_toolset_20260401"}],
)
 
pricing_modeler = make_agent(
    "pricing_modeler",
    "Builds two or three pricing options for a prospect based on seat count and expected usage.",
    """Pricing rules are in /mnt/user-data/pricing_rules.md. Given a prospect's estimated seat count and usage tier, build:
- a conservative option (annual commit, lower per-seat)
- a flexible option (monthly, higher per-seat)
- if seat count > 500, an enterprise option with a platform fee
Show the first-year total for each. Return via send_to_parent: {"options": [{"name": ..., "structure": ..., "year_one_total": ...}, ...]}""",
    [{"type": "agent_toolset_20260401"}],

3. Give the team something to work with
The librarian needs a library to choose from. We'll give it seven short case studies across healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, retail, fintech, and public sector, so you can see it actually pick the two that fit our prospect.

python

CASE_STUDIES = [
    {

        "industry": "specialty retail",
        "employees": 5600,
        "summary": """Challenge: store-level inventory exceptions handled by regional managers over Slack and spreadsheets.

        "summary": """Challenge: building-permit applications routed through five departments by paper packet.
Result with Northstar: single digital intake with parallel department review; median permit time 41 to 17 days.""",
    },
]

Product and pricing collateral
We'll also provide the product one-pager that the coordinator reads when writing the "How we help" section, and the pricing rules file that the modeler uses to build options.

python

PRODUCT = """# Northstar Platform — One-Pager
Northstar is a workflow automation platform for mid-market operations teams.

Typical results: 40-60% reduction in manual ticket handling, 3-week time-to-first-workflow."""
 
PRICING = """# Pricing Rules (internal)
- Per-seat list: $65/mo (monthly) or $52/mo (annual commit).
- Usage tiers: light = 1.0x, standard = 1.15x, heavy = 1.30x multiplier on per-seat.
- Enterprise (>500 seats): add $48,000/yr platform fee, per-seat drops to $44/mo annual.
- All options include onboarding; enterprise includes a named CSM."""

Wire up the coordinator and start a session
Now let's create an environment, upload the nine files, and create the coordinator with its multiagent roster of three specialists. Each entry is a full agent with its own model, prompt, and toolset, so you could mix model tiers per role.

python

env = client.beta.environments.create(
    name="proposal-meridian",
    config={"type": "anthropic_cloud", "networking": {"type": "unrestricted"}},
)
 
resources = []
 
 
def mount(path, content):
    f = client.beta.files.upload(
        file=(os.path.basename(path), content.encode(), "text/plain")
    )
    resources.append({"type": "file", "file_id": f.id, "mount_path": path})
 
 
for cs in CASE_STUDIES:
    body = f"# {cs['title']} ({cs['industry']}, {cs['employees']:,} employees)\n{cs['summary']}"
    mount(f"/mnt/user-data/case_studies/{cs['slug']}.md", body)
mount("/mnt/user-data/product_one_pager.md", PRODUCT)
mount("/mnt/user-data/pricing_rules.md", PRICING)
 
coordinator = client.beta.agents.create(
    name="Proposal Writer",
    model=MODEL,
    system="""You assemble tailored sales proposals.
Given a prospect name and basic profile:
1. Send the prospect's industry and size to prospect_researcher.
2. Send the prospect's industry, size, and (once the researcher reports back) their priorities to case_study_picker.
3. Send the seat count and usage tier to pricing_modeler.
4. Read /mnt/user-data/product_one_pager.md, then write /mnt/session/outputs/proposal.md with sections:

   Proof (the two case studies), Investment (the pricing options), Next steps.
Keep it to two pages.""",
    tools=[{"type": "agent_toolset_20260401"}],
    multiagent={
        "type": "coordinator",
        "agents": [prospect_researcher, case_study_picker, pricing_modeler],
    },
    betas=BETAS,
)
 
session = client.beta.sessions.create(
    agent={"type": "agent", "id": coordinator.id, "version": coordinator.version},
    environment_id=env.id,
    resources=resources,
    title="Proposal: Meridian Health",
    betas=BETAS,
)
print(f"Session {session.id} ready with {len(resources)} files mounted")
Session sesn_011Cahy5wq6Jyk32n2NwgR88 ready with 9 files mounted

4. Kick off the proposal
Let's send the prospect profile and watch the coordinator work. It will start the researcher and the pricing modeler in parallel, then run the case-study picker once the researcher's findings come back, since the picker needs those priorities to score relevance.

python

PROSPECT = {
    "name": "Meridian Health",
    "industry": "regional healthcare system",
    "employees": 8500,
    "estimated_seats": 600,
    "usage_tier": "heavy",
}
 
client.beta.sessions.events.send(
    session.id,
    betas=BETAS,
    events=[
        {
            "type": "user.message",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": f"Build a proposal for {PROSPECT['name']}, a {PROSPECT['industry']} with "
                    f"~{PROSPECT['employees']} employees. Estimate {PROSPECT['estimated_seats']} seats "
                    f"at {PROSPECT['usage_tier']} usage. Write to /mnt/session/outputs/proposal.md.",
                }
            ],
        }
    ],
)
 
with client.beta.sessions.events.stream(session.id, betas=BETAS) as stream:
    for ev in stream:
        if ev.type == "session.thread_created":
            print(f"[spawn] {ev.agent_name}")
        elif ev.type == "agent.thread_message_received":
            print(f"[report] {ev.from_agent_name} returned")
        elif ev.type == "session.status_idle":
            print("[done]")
            break
[spawn] prospect_researcher

[spawn] pricing_modeler

[report] prospect_researcher returned

[spawn] case_study_picker

[report] pricing_modeler returned

[report] case_study_picker returned

[done]

What each teammate sent back
Before we look at the assembled proposal, let's print the three raw send_to_parent payloads. Each subagent ran in its own context with only its own tools, so the three reports look quite different from one another.

python

def text_of(content):
    return "".join(b.text for b in content if b.type == "text")
 
 
for ev in client.beta.sessions.events.list(session.id, limit=1000, betas=BETAS):
    if ev.type == "agent.thread_message_received":
        body = text_of(ev.content)
        print(f"━━━ send_to_parent from {ev.from_agent_name} ({len(body)} chars) ━━━")
        print(body[:1200] + (f"\n…[{len(body) - 1200} more chars]" if len(body) > 1200 else ""))
        print()

Here is the structured research for tailoring a sales proposal to Meridian Health (regional healthcare system, ~8,500 employees):

## 1. TOP 3–5 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR REGIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN 2025–2026

**Priority 1: Financial Resilience & Cost Containment**
- Regional health systems are under intense financial pressure from reimbursement shortfalls, labor cost inflation, and policy changes (e.g., Medicaid cuts, 340B reforms under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act). Per Plante Moran: "Medicaid changes could create tens of millions in revenue shortfalls for some systems." Cash flow acceleration, revenue cycle optimization, and cost control without compromising care quality are top-of-mind.
- EY notes: "Reimbursement, labor shortage and cost inflation headwinds are compounded by the need to invest in leading clinical programs." Regional health systems specifically are "signaling the strategic importance of increasing scale in the face of accelerating costs."

**Priority 2: Workforce Retention, Burnout Reduction & Staffing Optimization**

5. Read the proposal
Finally, let's pull the assembled proposal. The coordinator wrote it to proposal.md with the write tool, so we'll find that event in the log and look at the sections it produced. Print proposal itself if you want to read the full document.

python

proposal = ""
for ev in client.beta.sessions.events.list(session.id, limit=1000, betas=BETAS):
    if (
        ev.type == "agent.tool_use"
        and ev.name == "write"
        and ev.input["file_path"].endswith("proposal.md")
    ):
        proposal = ev.input["content"]
        break
 
# Show the section structure rather than the full proposal.
for line in proposal.splitlines():
    if line.startswith("#"):
        print(line)
# Northstar Platform — Proposal for Meridian Health
## Executive Summary
## How We Help
## Proof — Results from Healthcare Organizations Like Yours
### St. Clair Health — Regional Hospital Network, 6,200 Employees
### BlueRidge Health Plan — Regional Health Plan, 2,800 Employees
## Investment — Three Options for 600 Seats, Heavy Usage
## Next Steps

Why three subagents instead of one
A single agent with all three tools could write this proposal, so why split it up? Scoping each role to its own tools means the pricing modeler can't pull a competitor's list price off the web, because it only has the rules file. The case-study picker reads seven files here, but in production it would read hundreds, and that volume stays in the subagent's context instead of the coordinator's. And the coordinator gets to decide the order and the hand-offs without doing any of the specialist work itself.

For more on multi-agent coordination, see the Managed Agents documentation.
