# 101 — mdeai Sponsorship Marketplace: Deep Research + Build Plan

> **Bottom line up front.** Zero dedicated sponsorship marketplace platforms exist for Latin America. Colombia's events market is growing at 9.9% CAGR. No platform closes the full loop: marketplace discovery + AI management + payment + ROI reporting in one product. mdeai can own this market in Medellín first, then expand to Bogotá and LATAM.

## A. Platform comparison table

| Platform | Type | Business model | AI features | Payment | Colombia-ready | Entry price |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anvara** | Marketplace | Unknown (listing + access fee) | Audience data matching | No | No (US only) | Unknown |
| **SponsorPitch** | Data + CRM + marketplace | Subscription $39–$334/user/mo | None | No | No | $0 (free tier) |
| **SponsorFlo** | Management SaaS (supply-side) | Subscription $299–$799/mo | Most comprehensive in market | Stripe | No | $299/mo |
| **Sponsoo** | Marketplace (sports) | 20% commission on closed deals | None | Yes (on deal close) | No (Europe-heavy) | Free (20% cut) |
| **SponsorMyEvent** | Two-sided marketplace | Unknown (freemium) | Unknown | No | No | Unknown |
| **Brella** | Event platform + sponsor tools | Enterprise custom | AI scheduling/matchmaking | No | No | Enterprise |
| **SponsorUnited** | Data intelligence | Enterprise SaaS ($K–$100K+/yr) | AI analyst + benchmarking | No | No | Enterprise |
| **OpenSponsorship** | Marketplace (athletes) | Subscription $499+/mo | Minimal | No | No | $499/mo |
| **InstantSponsor** | Blockchain marketplace | Token-based | Algorithm matching | Crypto | No | $5,000 brand min |
| **Adsly** | Marketplace (creators) | Subscription $0–$15/mo + 0% commission | None | No | No | Free |
| **Covent** | Managed events service | Fixed $3k–$15k/event | None | Yes | No | $3,000/event |
| **Grip** | Event platform + sponsorship | Enterprise custom | AI meeting scheduling | No | No | Enterprise |
| **mdeai (planned)** | **Full-stack marketplace** | **Hybrid: 15% commission + freemium SaaS** | **5 Gemini AI fns + concierge chat** | **Stripe** | **Yes (Medellín-first)** | **Free to list** |

### Five critical market gaps mdeai can exploit

1. **No LATAM competitor.** Zero dedicated sponsorship marketplace platforms operate in Colombia, Mexico, or Latin America. mdeai moves first.
2. **No full-lifecycle platform below enterprise.** SponsorFlo has AI management but no discovery marketplace. Anvara has discovery but no management or payment. mdeai builds both.
3. **No WhatsApp-native outreach.** All platforms use email-only. Colombia is a WhatsApp-first country.
4. **No real-time ROI reporting tied to actual ticket/event sales.** mdeai can do this because it already has the booking/event data in the same DB.
5. **No platform charges commission only** (risk-aligned) below the enterprise tier. Sponsoo does 20% but is Europe-only and sports-only. mdeai can undercut on commission (15%) for a comparable value prop.

## D. Real-world use cases for Medellín events

### 1. Beauty pageant — "Reinado Antioqueño 2026"

**Event profile:** 500 contestants, 3 rounds over 2 months, 10,000 live attendees at finals, 100k+ online votes.

**Sponsor targets:** Leonisa (lingerie/fashion), Yanbal (cosmetics), Dove, L'Oréal Colombia, Claro (telecom), Bancolombia.

**Packages:**
- Bronze ($500): Logo on voting page + 1 push notification mention
- Silver ($2,000): + Contestant profile badge ("¡Apoyada por Yanbal!") + 5 WA broadcasts
- Gold ($7,500): + Title sponsor of 1 round + booth at semifinals + AI creative gen
- Platinum ($20,000): "Reinado Antioqueño presentado por Leonisa" — full naming rights

**Activation mechanics:** `contestant_sponsor` surface type (existing schema). Each contestant has sponsor badge on profile. Every vote page shows sponsor logo.

**ROI hook:** "Yanbal's branded contestant page saw 23,400 impressions. 4,200 unique users clicked through to Yanbal.com. 12 purchased within 24h via UTM tracking."

**WhatsApp angle:** Leaderboard screenshot sent every 4h via OpenClaw has sponsor watermark bottom-right. 50,000 subscribers see it 6× per day = 300,000 branded impressions/day.

---

### 2. Fashion event — "Medellín Fashion Week 2026"

**Event profile:** 200 designers, 3-day runway shows, 5,000 ticketed attendees, 2M social impressions.

**Sponsor targets:** Leonisa, Punto Blanco, Arket (Colombian line), Banco de Bogotá (checkout partner), Renault (lifestyle mobility).

**Packages:**
- Gold ($8,000): Category sponsor "Best Emerging Designer powered by Banco de Bogotá"
- Platinum ($25,000): Title sponsor + official car fleet (Renault) + runway activation

**AI angle:** `sponsor-creative-gen` produces bilingual fashion copy for each sponsor: "Estilo que transforma. Moda que empodera. Presentado por Leonisa." — 5 caption variants for IG + TikTok.

**ROI tracking:** Ticket UTMs (`?ref=leonisa-banner`) + post-show PDF report from `sponsor-roi-explain`.

---

### 3. Restaurant week — "Sabores de Medellín 2026"

**Event profile:** 80 participating restaurants, 2-week event, 30,000 diners using the mdeai discovery feature.

**Sponsor targets:** Postobón (beverage), Grupo Nutresa (food brands), Bavaria (beer), Mastercard (checkout rewards), Rappi (delivery).

**Packages:**
- Bronze ($500): Logo in restaurant discovery page + 2 push notifs ("Sabores de Medellín, powered by Postobón")
- Silver ($2,500): + Featured restaurant carousel on mdeai homepage + social post series
- Gold ($8,000): + Category sponsor "Best Bandeja Paisa powered by Nutresa" + physical signage kit for 20 participating restaurants

**Unique activation:** Rappi sponsors the "Order + Vote" feature — users who order via Rappi get 2x votes in the Best Restaurant ranking. Real transaction data = verified attribution.

---

### 4. Music / nightlife — "Circuito Electrónico Medellín"

**Event profile:** 12 club nights over 3 months, 500–2,000 attendees per night, 18–35 demographic.

**Sponsor targets:** Águila beer, Club Colombia, Red Bull, Claro (co-branded phone charging stations), Spotify (playlist sponsorship).

**Packages:**
- Bronze ($500): Logo on event listing + WA broadcast mention per night
- Silver ($1,500 for 3 nights): + Door staff badge + physical signage

---

### 5. Sports tournament — "Copa Fútbol Barrial Medellín"

**Event profile:** 64 teams, 8-week grassroots tournament, 3,000 weekly spectators, hyper-local community audience.

**Sponsor targets:** Colanta (dairy), Auteco (motorcycles), local construction companies, Aseguradora Solidaria.

- Silver ($1,500): + Banner at main field + photo in weekly WhatsApp leaderboard
- Gold ($4,000): Category sponsor "Goleador del torneo powered by Colanta" + trophy naming

**Insight:** Price points are lower than tier events but volume is much higher. 64 teams × $500 avg = $32,000 potential per tournament. Community brands don't need Platinum — they need authentic local presence.

---

### 6. Influencer event — "Creator Day Medellín"

**Event profile:** 500-person creator gathering, 50 invited nano/micro influencers, brand activation booths, 48h content creation sprint.

**Sponsor targets:** Adobe, Ring (Amazon), Samsung, Listerine (lifestyle), Bancolombia digital (fintech).

**AI angle:** `sponsor-creative-gen` generates the challenge brief + prize copy for each creator in their voice. Saves sponsor 3 days of agency work.

---

### 7. Business conference — "Startup Grind Medellín 2026"

**Event profile:** 800 attendees, C-suite + tech founders, 2-day conference, $2M+ collective annual revenue in room.

**Attribution hook:** Badge scans at sponsor booth → instant lead to Salesforce/HubSpot via `sponsor-audience-match` output (pre-event audience profile shared with sponsor 2 weeks before).

## E. Recommended mdeai sponsorship marketplace MVP

### What to build (the minimum viable marketplace)

**Current state:** mdeai has a one-sided system. Sponsors apply to mdeai (the organizer). There is no marketplace — no brand discovery, no event browsing by sponsors, no two-way matching.

**MVP upgrade:** Add the discovery layer that turns a single-org tool into a two-sided marketplace.

### Six new pages required

```
/marketplace                      → Landing: "Find your next sponsorship" + "List your event"
/marketplace/events               → Browse events: filter by category, city, budget, audience size
/marketplace/events/:eventId      → Event sponsorship profile (audience, packages, past sponsors, apply)
/marketplace/brands               → Browse active sponsors (for organizers to research)
/marketplace/brands/:orgId        → Brand profile (industry, past campaigns, verified budget tier)
/marketplace/inbox                → Two-way messaging between sponsors and organizers
```

### Five new DB tables required

```sql

  city            text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Medellín',

  embedding       vector(1536),                -- for semantic matching via pgvector
  updated_at      timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX ON sponsor.marketplace_index USING GIN (search_vector);
CREATE INDEX ON sponsor.marketplace_index USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

### Three new edge functions required

```
POST /sponsor-event-profile-upsert   Organizer creates/updates their marketplace listing
POST /sponsor-proposal-create        Sponsor sends a proposal to an organizer
POST /sponsor-message-send           In-platform messaging (webhook to WhatsApp via OpenClaw)
```

### MVP acceptance criteria

- Organizer can publish their event on `/marketplace/events` in < 10 minutes
- Sponsor can browse events, filter by category + budget, click through to event profile
- Sponsor can send a proposal with package selection and message
- Organizer receives proposal in inbox + WhatsApp notification
- Deal flow: proposal → accept → auto-creates `sponsor.applications` → proceeds to existing checkout flow

---

## H. Tool stack recommendation

### Core stack (already in mdeai)

| Layer | Tool | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector | All sponsor data + semantic search |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Organizer + sponsor login |
| Frontend | Vite + React + shadcn/ui | All pages |
| Payments | Stripe | Checkout + commission billing |
| AI decisions | Gemini (via `_shared/gemini.ts`) | 9 edge fns |
| Storage | Supabase Storage | Logo, video, contract PDF assets |
| Realtime | Supabase Realtime | Dashboard live updates |

### Outreach stack (Phase 2+)

| Layer | Tool | Role | When to add |
|---|---|---|---|
| Messaging | OpenClaw | WhatsApp + email outreach, WA notifications | Week 1 (already configured) |
| Social scheduling | Postiz | Instagram, TikTok, X campaign posts | Month 2 (3+ active sponsors) |
| Scraping | Firecrawl | Colombiamoda sponsor pages, web enrichment | Month 2 (discovery pipeline) |
| Reasoning | Hermes | Lead scoring, renewal prediction | Month 2 (Hermes Python CLI) |
| Governance | Paperclip | Lifecycle tracking, approval gates, budget control | Month 3+ (10+ sponsors) |
| Contact enrichment | Fire Enrich | $0.01–0.05/lead, email + phone enrichment | Month 3 (50+ prospects) |

### What NOT to use

| Tool | Why not |
|---|---|
| SponsorFlo | $299–799/mo for features already being built in-house at $0 marginal cost |
| SponsorUnited | Enterprise pricing, sports-heavy, no Colombia data |
| PhantomBuster / LinkedIn scraping | TOS violation → account ban → zero discovery |
| Apify for Instagram | Same risk; use Firecrawl + public signals instead |
| Clay | $720+/mo; Fire Enrich does same at $0.01–0.05/lead |
| Blockchain/crypto payments | No adoption in Colombian SMB market |

---

## I. Risks and red flags

### Critical risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stripe secrets not set** | High (known gap) | Payments broken → zero revenue | Set within 48h. Escalate now. |
| **Marketplace stays empty** — chicken-and-egg problem | High | No sponsors if no events; no events if no sponsors | Seed manually: publish 5 real events yourself in week 3. Don't launch empty. |
| **Colombian brands don't trust a new platform** | Medium | Low conversion on outreach | Lead with Bancolombia/EPM anchor deal → social proof for everyone else |
| **WhatsApp Business API rate limits** | Medium | OpenClaw outreach throttled | Stay under 1,000 messages/day; verify Infobip number has approved templates |
| **Commission model deters organizers** | Medium | Low supply side | Offer "first deal free" (0% commission) for first 3 events per organizer |
| **Fulfillment disputes** (sponsor says impressions weren't delivered) | Medium | Chargebacks, brand damage | Every impression logged with timestamp + viewer anon_id. Report available on demand. |
| **Data quality on demographics** | Medium | AI matching returns bad recommendations | Make demographics field self-reported initially; don't overclaim AI precision |

### Red flags from competitor research

1. **"Can a sponsorship marketplace finally work?"** — The Sponsor.com's headline on Anvara explicitly acknowledges the historic failure rate of sponsorship marketplaces. The reason: data quality. Self-reported audience demographics are unreliable. Anvara solves this with mobile location data (expensive, US-only). mdeai's advantage: it already has real booking and event attendance data in the DB. Use it.

2. **Sponsoo's 20% commission** got pushback. mdeai should use **15% commission** as the differentiator.

3. **SponsorFlo's 23% statistic** — 23% of sponsorship revenue lost annually due to poor fulfillment tracking. This is mdeai's biggest operational risk. The deliverables checklist + impression logging mitigates it. Never promise what you can't track.

4. **B2B sales cycle is long** (1–5 months at the corporate level). For V1, target SMB Colombian brands ($500–5,000 deals) that can move in 1–5 days, not corporate procurement cycles. Go big on corporate later.

5. **The blockchain angle** (InstantSponsor) is a dead end for Colombia. Crypto payment adoption in Colombian SMBs is negligible. Stick with Stripe + bank transfer.

## J. Exact next steps (in order, start Monday)

### This week (days 1–5)

**Day 1 — Unblock payments:**
```
1. Log into Supabase dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
2. Add: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_SPONSOR_WEBHOOK_SECRET, FRONTEND_URL
3. Test with Stripe test card 4242 4242 4242 4242 → confirm invoice created

**Commission models compared:**

| Paved (newsletters) | 30% of deal value |
| Traditional agency | 10–15% of deal value |
| **mdeai (recommended)** | **15% of deal value** |

**Why 15%:**

- Free to list → no upfront cost risk for organizers, lowers supply-side adoption friction
- First-deal free for first 3 events per organizer → accelerates marketplace seeding

| Stream | When | Price point | Monthly upside |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platform commission (15%) | On every closed deal | 15% of deal value | $750 per $5k deal |

- 20 featured listings × $75 = $1,500
- 15 Pro organizer subscriptions × $99 = $1,485
- 3 managed events × $1,000 = $3,000
- **Total: ~$19,500/month MRR at Month 6** (conservative; assumes 30 sponsors on platform)
