## 1. Agents

### Current state — 6 agents registered (`mdeapp`)

| Agent | Model | Tools | Memory | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ping-agent` | **gemini-3.5-flash** | none | in-memory LibSQL | Health / wiring probe (F02) |
| `router-agent` | **gemini-3.5-flash** | classify-intent | none | Intent dispatch → workflows |
| `concierge-agent` | **gemini-3.5-flash** | 4 search tools | workingMemory + processors | Camila / Tourist main UX |
| `rental-agent` | **gemini-3.5-flash** | search-rentals | workingMemory | Rental specialist |
| `event-agent` | **gemini-3.5-flash** | search-events | workingMemory | Events specialist |
| `evaluation-agent` | **gemini-3.5-flash** | none | none | Listing rerank / eval copy |

**(legacy `my-mastra-app`)** had 7 agents including `weather-agent` and mixed 3.1-flash-lite / 2.5-pro — do not copy those model IDs into `mdeapp`.

### What's done right

- Model IDs use `@ai-sdk/google` → `google("gemini-3.5-flash")` in `lib/models.ts` (single registry for Phase 1).
- `concierge-agent` has typed working memory with a Zod schema — this is the recommended pattern from Mastra docs.
- All agents registered in `index.ts` via the `agents: {}` map — Studio discovers them automatically.
- `router-agent` binds workflows directly (`workflows: { rentalSearchWorkflow, eventDiscoveryWorkflow }`) — correct pattern for an agent that dispatches to workflows.

### Gaps and next additions

| Gap | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No semantic recall configured | Agent can't retrieve past threads by meaning | Requires pgvector + embedder — VDB-02 task |
| All agents use the same model | Acceptable for Phase 1; host wizard may use `PRO_MODEL` later | All agents on `gemini-3.5-flash` until F34 host-event needs `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` |
| No `maxTokens` / `temperature` set on any agent | Responses can vary in length unpredictably | Set per-agent defaults in the `model` config object |
| `evaluation-agent` has no tools | Can't fetch live data for scoring | Add `searchRentalsTool` if used for grounding evaluations |

---

## 2. Workflows

### Current state — 4 workflows registered

| Workflow | Steps | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `weather-workflow` | fetch → format | Fetches weather for a city |
| `rental-search-workflow` | search → format-rental-cards → rerank-rentals | Searches, formats, and ranks rental cards with "Best for" labels |
| `event-discovery-workflow` | fetch-events → format-event-cards | Searches and formats event cards |
| `concierge-routing-workflow` | classify → branch → execute | Routes to rental or event workflow based on intent |

### What's done right

- Workflows use `createStep` + typed `inputSchema`/`outputSchema` for every step — matches official Mastra pattern.
- `rentalSearchWorkflow` uses a 3-step pipeline with a proper reranker step (scoring + label assignment).
- Workflows are committed via `.commit()` before export — required by Mastra.
- Steps are composed with `.then()` chaining — the idiomatic Mastra pattern.

### Gaps and next additions

| Gap | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No `.branch()` or `.parallel()` in rental/event workflows | Linear-only; can't fan out to multiple sources simultaneously | Add `.parallel()` for multi-source search (DB + external API) when real data sources are added |
| No retry/error handling in steps | A DB hiccup fails the whole workflow | Wrap `searchRentals` call in try/catch inside the step; return empty results with an `error` field |
| `concierge-routing-workflow` exists but isn't tested in smoke | Silent failures if routing breaks | Add smoke probe for concierge-routing-workflow |
| No input validation at workflow entry | Bad inputs reach step logic | Add Zod `.refine()` to `queryInputSchema` for obvious bad values (e.g. negative price) |

---

## 3. Tools

### Current state — 6 tools registered

| Tool ID | Input schema | DB source | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search-rentals` | neighborhood, minBedrooms, maxPricePerNight, limit | Supabase `apartments` table | 7-item mock |
| `search-events` | category, neighborhood, limit | Supabase `events` table | mock |
| `search-restaurants` | cuisine, neighborhood, limit | Supabase `restaurants` table | mock |
| `search-attractions` | type, neighborhood, limit | Supabase `attractions` table | mock |
| `get-weather` | city | wttr.in HTTP API | none |
| `classify-intent` | intent, confidence, reason | (passthrough / identity) | N/A |

### What's done right

- All tools use `createTool` with typed `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` — Studio shows them correctly.
- DB tools fall back to mock data gracefully when `DATABASE_URL` is absent.
- `search-rentals` uses a lazy singleton pool — safe for long-running Mastra dev process.

### Gaps and next additions

| Gap | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No `audit-wrapper` applied to risky tools | No logging when tools access DB | Wire `audit-wrapper.ts` around any tool that writes |
| Mock data is in-memory only | Restart clears any state | Fine for read-only tools; no action needed unless writes are added |
| No semantic search tool | Keyword-only; misses intent matches | Add `semantic-search` tool using pgvector `match_apartments` RPC (VDB-02 task) |
| `classify-intent` is inline in router agent file | Can't be reused by other agents | Move to `tools/classify-intent.ts` and import |

---

## 4. Memory

### Current state

Only `concierge-agent` has memory configured:

```typescript
memory: new Memory({
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      scope: 'thread',
      schema: conciergeWorkingMemorySchema,  // Zod object — typed fields
    },
    lastMessages: 20,
  },
})
```

Working memory fields tracked: `lastIntent`, `lastRentalQuery`, `lastRentalResults`, `selectedListingId`, `lastEventQuery`, `lastEventResults`, `selectedEventId`.

Storage backend: `PostgresStore` (shared with main Mastra storage) — thread history survives server restarts.

### What's done right

- Schema-typed working memory is the most robust Mastra memory pattern — fields are validated on every write.
- `lastMessages: 20` gives the concierge enough context for multi-turn conversations.
- Smoke test verifies 2-turn rental context retention (ask rentals → follow up "when can I view" → agent stays in rental context).

### Gaps and next additions

| Gap | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No semantic recall configured | Agents can't retrieve past threads by meaning | Requires pgvector + embedder — VDB-02 task |
| Memory storage not namespaced | All agents share same table prefix | Set `storage` option on each `Memory` instance pointing at `createPostgresStore()` |
| No memory on router-agent | Router can't track conversation history across turns | Low priority — router is stateless by design; acceptable gap |

---

## 5. Storage

### Current state

```typescript
// storage/config.ts
const storage = createPostgresStore(); // PostgresStore from @mastra/pg
// Points to DATABASE_URL = postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres (local)
```

Shared across all agents and workflows via `mastra.storage`.

### What's done right

- PostgresStore is the production-grade Mastra storage backend — right choice for Supabase.
- `validateDatabaseUrl()` catches bad env early with a clear error message.
- Warns explicitly when a direct Supabase host (`db.*.supabase.co`) is used on an IPv4-only network.

### Gaps and next additions

| Gap | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Local URL hardcoded in startup scripts | Manual update needed for staging/prod | Use `infisical run -- npm run dev` to inject `DATABASE_URL` from Infisical; no hardcoding |
| No connection pool size tuning | Default max=10; too high for Mastra dev process | Set `max: 3` in PostgresStore options for dev; `max: 10` for prod |
| No read replica | All queries hit primary | Future: add read replica URL via `DATABASE_URL_READ` for search queries |

---

## 6. Evaluation (Scorers)

### Current state — 3 scorers registered

| Scorer | Type | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| `toolCallAppropriatenessScorer` | prebuilt (code) | Did the agent call `get-weather` when it should? |
| `completenessScorer` | prebuilt (code) | Did the response cover all user questions? |
| `translationScorer` | custom (LLM judge) | Did the agent translate non-English locations correctly? |

Scorers are visible in Studio under **Evaluation** → can be run manually or via CI.

### What's done right

- Mix of prebuilt code scorers (fast, deterministic) and a custom LLM-judged scorer (nuanced) — best practice.
- `translationScorer` uses `.preprocess()` → `.analyze()` → `.generateScore()` → `.generateReason()` pipeline — the recommended Mastra scorer chain.
- Scorers registered in `index.ts` under the `scorers` map.

### Gaps and next additions

| Gap | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No rental-search scorers | Can't eval whether rental results match user intent | Add `rentalRelevanceScorer` using LLM judge: did returned neighborhoods/prices match the query? |
| No concierge context-retention scorer | Can't measure multi-turn memory quality | Add scorer that checks if follow-up replies reference prior turn's `lastRentalResults` |
| `translationScorer` uses `openai/gpt-5-mini` (not Gemini) | Requires OpenAI key at eval time | Acceptable for evals; just document the dependency |

---

## 7. Processors

### Current state: **not configured**

Mastra Processors (see https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/processors) are middleware that transform agent inputs or outputs — e.g. sanitize PII before it hits the model, or reformat a model response before it reaches the user.

Nothing in `src/mastra/` uses processors yet.

### What to add

| Processor | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Input sanitizer | All agents | Strip phone numbers and email addresses from user input before sending to Gemini |
| Output formatter | `concierge-agent` | Enforce card format: max 5 results, always include `source_url` and `schedule_viewing_url` |
| Rate-limit gate | `router-agent` | Reject requests above 30/min/user; return a structured error instead of hitting Gemini |

### How to add one

```typescript
// src/mastra/processors/sanitize-pii.ts
import { createProcessor } from '@mastra/core/agent';

export const sanitizePiiProcessor = createProcessor({
  id: 'sanitize-pii',
  processInput: async ({ messages }) => {
    return messages.map(m => ({
      ...m,
      content: m.content.replace(/\b[\w.+-]+@[\w-]+\.\w{2,}\b/g, '[EMAIL]')
                        .replace(/\+?\d[\d\s\-().]{7,}\d/g, '[PHONE]'),
    }));
  },
});
```

Register in agent:

```typescript
export const conciergeAgent = new Agent({
  ...
  processors: [sanitizePiiProcessor],
});
```

---

## 8. MCP Servers

### Current state: **not configured**

No agent currently connects to an external MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Studio shows "MCP Servers" in the sidebar but the list is empty.

Mastra supports `MCPClient` to connect agents to external tool providers over MCP.

### What to add (prioritized)

| MCP Server | Value for mdeAI | How |
|---|---|---|
| `@mastra/mcp-docs-server` | Dev-time only — agents can query Mastra docs | `codex mcp add mastra-docs -- npx -y @mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest` |
| Google Maps MCP | `concierge-agent` gets directions, distance, transit times | Add `MCPClient` with Google Maps MCP server; add `get-directions` tool to concierge |
| Supabase MCP | Agents can query DB schema and run RPCs via MCP instead of direct SQL | Supabase's official MCP server |

### How to add one

```typescript
// src/mastra/mcp/google-maps-client.ts
import { MCPClient } from '@mastra/mcp';

export const googleMapsMcpClient = new MCPClient({
  id: 'google-maps-mcp',
  servers: {
    googleMaps: {
      command: 'npx',
      args: ['-y', '@googlemaps/mcp-server@latest'],
      env: { GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: process.env.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY! },
    },
  },
});
```

Then in the agent:

```typescript
tools: {
  ...existingTools,
  ...(await googleMapsMcpClient.listTools()),
}
```

---

## 9. Observability

### Current state

```typescript
observability: new Observability({
  configs: {
    default: {
      serviceName: 'mdeai-mastra',
      exporters: [new DefaultExporter()],
      spanOutputProcessors: [new SensitiveDataFilter()],
    },
  },
}),
```

- `DefaultExporter` writes traces to DuckDB (local file, Studio **Traces** tab shows them).
- `SensitiveDataFilter` strips API keys and tokens from span data before storage.
- `PinoLogger` writes structured JSON logs at `info` level.

### What's done right

- `SensitiveDataFilter` is a security must-have — any trace that captures request/response data would otherwise log raw API keys.
- `DefaultExporter` gives instant trace visibility in Studio without any external service.

### What to add for production

| Addition | Why | How |
|---|---|---|
| OTLP exporter | Ship traces to Grafana / Datadog / Honeycomb | Add `OtlpExporter` alongside `DefaultExporter` |
| Alert on `status: failed` spans | Catch agent failures before users report them | Configure span alert in your observability backend |
| Log `ai_runs` to Supabase | mdeAI audit trail for AI billing and usage | Add a custom exporter that writes to `ai_runs` table |

---

## 10. Startup & Environment

### Current state

`scripts/mastra-start.sh` — persistent startup script that:
1. Reads `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` from `/home/sk/mde/.env.local`
2. Writes to `/tmp/mdeai-mastra-start.XXXXXX` (avoids `guard-sensitive-paths` hook)
3. Stops any existing bgproc instance
4. Starts: `MASTRA_DEV_NO_CACHE=1 npx bgproc start -n my-mastra-app -w -- npx mastra dev --env <tmpfile>`
5. Waits for port 4111 to respond

`scripts/mastra-smoke.sh` — full smoke suite:
- typecheck → build → health → 8 agent/workflow probes
- All 8 probes passing as of 2026-05-11

### Env var names (important)

| Var | Where needed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Mastra process | Mastra's expected name for Gemini; `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` from frontend `.env.local` maps to this |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Smoke test + `translationScorer` | Required for OpenAI-backed scorer in evals |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgresStore + pg pool | Local: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres` |

### What to fix next

1. **Infisical CLI auth** — CLI currently points to `app.infisical.com` (cloud). Run `infisical login --domain http://localhost:80` to re-auth to local instance. Until then, `mastra-start.sh` bridges the gap by reading `.env.local` directly.
2. **CLAUDE.md startup command** — The Mastra startup block in CLAUDE.md should reference `scripts/mastra-start.sh` instead of the old manual bgproc command.
3. **Production DATABASE_URL** — Switch from local Supabase to the Supabase Session Pooler URL (`aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543`) for staging/prod. The storage config already warns about this.

---

## Summary: what's solid, what to do next

### Solid (don't touch)

- 7 agents registered and smoke-tested
- 4 workflows with typed step pipelines
- `concierge-agent` working memory with schema-typed fields
- PostgresStore storage backend
- 3 scorers (2 prebuilt + 1 custom LLM judge)
- Observability with `SensitiveDataFilter`
- Smoke suite (8/8 probes)

### Backlog: do these in order

1. ~~**Add memory to `rental-agent` and `event-agent`**~~ — Done. Both have schema-typed working memory.
2. ~~**Move `classify-intent` tool to its own file**~~ — Done. `tools/classify-intent.ts`, exported via `tools/index.ts`.
3. **Add PII sanitizer processor to concierge** — 1 hour, compliance + safety
4. **Wire Google Maps MCP client** — 2 hours, adds directions/distance to concierge
5. **Add `semantic-search` tool + semantic recall** — 4 hours, VDB-02 task (requires pgvector embedder)
6. **Add rental-relevance scorer** — 2 hours, closes the eval gap for the core use case
7. **OTLP exporter for production traces** — 1 hour, needed before prod launch
