## 3. Advanced Activation Strategies

### Real-time engagement during events

```
Architecture:
  Supabase Realtime → broadcast channel → mdeai web/app
  
  During voting window:
    Every 60s: UPDATE sponsor.roi_daily WHERE day=today
    Every 30s: broadcast leaderboard update to connected clients
    Sponsor leaderboard_footer impression count updates live
    Admin sees: "412 people currently viewing contest — Postobón banner served 5,847 times this hour"
```

### Second-screen experience

```
User flow:
  1. Attendee at venue opens mdeai.co on phone
  2. GPS/event code confirms they're on-site → "Bienvenido a Reina de Antioquia 2026"
  3. Sponsor banner: "Patrocinado por Claro — Vota y gana datos gratis"
  4. Vote from phone → real-time rank on LED screen updates
  5. After voting: Claro offer: "Escanea para activar 5GB gratis"
  
  DB: events.geo_fence jsonb (lat/lng bounding box)
      impressions.is_onsite boolean (derived from geo-check)
      onsite impressions billed at 2× rate
```

### Personalized sponsor content

```
Supabase edge fn: sponsor-personalize
  Input: viewer_user_id OR viewer_anon_id
  
  Logic:
    1. Load viewer profile: age, gender, city, past_votes
    2. Load active placements for event
    3. Score each placement by viewer fit:
       - Beauty brand → female 18-34 → score +0.3
       - Beverage → male 18-24 → score +0.2
    4. Return highest-score placement for surface
    5. Log impression with viewer_segment='female_18_34'
    
  Result: same surface shows different sponsor to different users
```

### Geo-targeted on-site activations

```
Implementation:
  1. Event venue defines geo_fence polygon (Supabase PostGIS)
  2. Browser Geolocation API checks user position
  3. If inside fence: show on-site sponsor content variant
  4. QR stations trigger: "Estás en el venue — escanea para ganar"
  5. On-site impressions tracked separately (higher value billing)
```

## 4. Innovative / Cutting-Edge Ideas

### 4.1 Dynamic slot pricing

```sql
-- pricing_rules table
CREATE TABLE sponsor.pricing_rules (
  surface          text PRIMARY KEY,
  base_price_cents int NOT NULL,
  surge_multiplier float NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.0,
  surge_threshold  int NOT NULL DEFAULT 2,   -- # of competing applications
  max_multiplier   float NOT NULL DEFAULT 3.0
);

-- Edge fn: compute real-time price
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sponsor.get_current_price(p_surface text, p_event_id uuid)
RETURNS int AS $$
DECLARE
  v_competing int;
  v_base int;
  v_multiplier float;
BEGIN
  SELECT base_price_cents, surge_multiplier, surge_threshold, max_multiplier
  INTO v_base, ... FROM sponsor.pricing_rules WHERE surface = p_surface;
  
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_competing
  FROM sponsor.applications
  WHERE event_id = p_event_id
    AND activation_type = p_surface
    AND status IN ('submitted','under_review','approved');
  
  v_multiplier := LEAST(
    1.0 + (GREATEST(v_competing - v_surge_threshold, 0) * 0.25),
    v_max_multiplier
  );
  
  RETURN (v_base * v_multiplier)::int;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

UI: "2 brands are viewing this slot — price increases 25% if another brand applies today"

### 4.2 AI-generated highlight reels

```
Tool: Mootion API or HeyGen API
Trigger: event ends → workflow fires

Step 1: Pull top 10 contestant photos + vote counts from DB
Step 2: Generate video:
  - Mootion prompt: "Create 30s highlight reel of beauty contest.
    Sponsor: [Brand]. Colors: [brand_colors]. 
    Include: top 3 contestant photos, vote counts, event name."
Step 3: Overlay sponsor logo in corner (FFmpeg)
Step 4: Upload to Supabase Storage (events/highlights/)
Step 5: Share via:
  - Infobip WhatsApp to sponsor contact: "Tu reels está listo 🎬"
  - Auto-post to event Instagram via Meta Business API (optional)
  - Add to sponsor dashboard as "Your activation highlight"

Cost: ~$0.50–2.00/reel via API
ROI: Sponsor brand appears in 50K+ video views organically
```

### 4.3 Performance-based Bronze tier

```
Implementation:
  applications.pricing_model = 'cpa'
  flat_price_cents = 0
  rev_share_pct = 0.030   -- 3% of attributed purchase value

Monthly invoice generation:
  SELECT SUM(conversion_value_cents) * 0.030 AS invoice_amount
  FROM sponsor.attributions a
  JOIN sponsor.placements p ON p.id = a.placement_id
  WHERE p.application_id = $1
    AND a.attributed_at BETWEEN invoice_period_start AND invoice_period_end
    AND a.conversion_kind = 'purchase'

Stripe: create invoice programmatically each month end
Minimum: $200K COP/month (floor to cover platform cost)
```

### 4.4 AI-generated creative variants + A/B testing

```
Edge fn: sponsor-creative-gen (task 054 expanded)

Input: { brand_name, brand_colors, tagline, surface, event_name }

Gemini imagen prompt:
  "Create a 728×90 banner ad for [Brand] at [Event].
   Colors: [hex]. Include logo space on left.
   Tagline: '[tagline]'. Style: modern Colombian fashion."

Outputs 3 variants → stored in sponsor.assets
  
Rotation: placements serve variant A for 24h, then B, then C
Winner: roi_daily shows highest CTR variant → auto-promote to 100%
Loser variants: paused after 72h

No human creative work required per activation.
```

### 4.5 Gamified referral system

```
Flow:
  1. Sponsor funds a prize pool: $5M COP
  2. Event creates referral code: REINA2026-BAVARIA
  3. Attendees share code → friend buys ticket or votes
  4. Referrer gets points → leaderboard → top 3 win prize
  
  DB:
    sponsor.referral_codes (code, application_id, reward_per_referral_cents)
    sponsor.referrals (code_id, referrer_user_id, referred_user_id, converted_at)
  
  Attribution: referral → sponsor
  Sponsor sees: "Your $5M prize pool generated 3,200 referrals → 890 new votes"
  Cost per referral: ~$1,562 COP ($0.40 USD) — highly efficient
```

## 5. AI Features + Agent Workflows

### 5A. AI Content Generation

```
sponsor-creative-gen edge fn (Gemini Pro):

1. Banner ads:
   Input: brand_data + surface dimensions + event_theme
   Output: banner HTML/CSS OR Gemini imagen URL
   
2. Caption generator:
   Input: placement.surface + event.name + brand.tagline
   Output: 3 Instagram caption variants (Colombian Spanish)
   e.g., "✨ El evento del año llega con el respaldo de @leonisa
          Vota por tu reina favorita y gana sorpresas increíbles 🌺
          #ReinaDeAntioquia #Leonisa #Medellín"

3. WhatsApp message generator:
   Input: brand + prospect_data + event + match_score
   Output: 160-char personalized WhatsApp pitch
   
4. Proposal PDF:
   Input: event + sponsor + match_score + surface_mockups
   Output: 8-slide bilingual PDF via Gemini + HTML→PDF
```

### 5B. AI Matchmaking

```
sponsor-audience-match edge fn:

Score = (
  audience_overlap_pct × 0.35   -- Gemini compares brand vs event audience
  + category_fit × 0.25         -- lookup table
  + past_activity × 0.20        -- enrichment_data.sponsorship_frequency
  + local_presence × 0.10       -- Medellín HQ = 1.0
  + budget_fit × 0.10           -- tier affordability
)

Recommended surfaces per score range:
  score > 0.80 → title + contest_header + contestant_profile
  score 0.65–0.80 → leaderboard_footer + digital_banner
  score 0.50–0.65 → qr_station only
  score < 0.50 → micro-slot only
```

### 5C. AI Insights (Gemini Flash)

```
sponsor-roi-explain edge fn:

Prompt:
  "You are a sponsorship analyst.
   Brand: [brand_name]. Event: [event_name].
   Last 7 days data:
     Impressions: [n]. Clicks: [n]. CTR: [n]%.
     Attributed purchases: [n]. Cost per purchase: $[n] COP.
     Top surface: [surface] (CTR [n]%).
     Audience: [breakdown].
   
   Write 3 bullet insights in Colombian Spanish:
   1. What is performing well and why
   2. What to optimize
   3. Predicted performance next 7 days
   
   Keep it concise, data-driven, actionable."

Output stored in applications.campaign_goals.ai_insight
Refreshed daily by pg_cron
```

### 5D. AI Optimization Agent

```
Trigger: daily cron OR when CTR drops >20% vs 7-day average

sponsor-optimize edge fn logic:

IF surface_ctr < platform_avg_ctr × 0.7:
  → "Move to higher-traffic surface: leaderboard_footer → contest_header"
  → Push recommendation to sponsor dashboard
  → Admin gets Realtime notification

IF peak_hour not in current_schedule:
  → "Your CTR peaks Tue-Thu 18:00-21:00 — recommend scheduling impressions 
     to weight 3× during this window"

IF creative.age > 14 days AND CTR_trend = 'declining':
  → "Creative fatigue detected — generating 3 fresh variants"
  → Trigger sponsor-creative-gen
  → Admin approval → auto-swap

## 8. Channel Strategy — Colombia / Medellín

### Channel priority matrix

```
WhatsApp Business (Infobip)
  → Priority #1 for ALL outreach in Colombia
  → 92% smartphone penetration, 89% daily WhatsApp usage
  → Businesses expect WhatsApp contact (not email)
  → Response rate: 35% vs 8% email
  → Use: prospect outreach, sponsor alerts, renewal, reel delivery
  → Constraint: task-specific flows only (Jan 2026 policy)
  → Template approval: 2–5 business days via Meta

Instagram (OpenClaw + Meta Business API)
  → Priority #1 for fashion, beauty, lifestyle brands
  → Medellín influencer ecosystem: 50+ macro (500k+ followers)
