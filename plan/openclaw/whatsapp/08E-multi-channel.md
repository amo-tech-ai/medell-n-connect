> **What:** Epic 8: Multi-Channel (WhatsApp) — index file; use this to sequence all WA + OpenClaw tasks in the right order
> **Why:** Without a sequencing index, developers start 08B before the critical ADRs (08F ingress choice, 08K provider strategy) are decided, causing rework. This file defines the dependency graph so every task in E8 knows what must complete before it can start.
> **Tools:** (index file — no tools; tracks all E8 task files)
> **Workflow:** **Goal:** E8 tasks sequenced correctly; no task starts before its ADR blockers are resolved. → **Workflow:** 08F + 08K (decisions) → 05M (security gate) → 08H (Phase 1 echo) → 08B (full AI, Phases 2-4) → 08G + 08I (parallel). → **Proof:** 08F signed off, 08K signed off, 05M green, 08H echo passes — then 08B can start.
> **Success Criteria:**
> - 08F (ingress decision) and 08K (provider strategy) signed off before any code in 08B
> - 05M (security audit) passes before public WA number shared with users
> - 08H echo test passes before Phase 2 AI chain built
> - 08G correlation IDs active before WA channel goes to >10 users
> **ADVANCED · P2 · Open**

# Epic 8: Multi-Channel (WhatsApp) — index

> **Diagrams:** MERM-04 (chat flow), MERM-07 (agent architecture)  
> **Phase:** ADVANCED | **Outcome:** O5  
> **Hypothesis:** WhatsApp integration captures leads from non-web users, converting >=10%.

## Feature success (goals → shippable features)

Aligned with [`PROMPT-VERIFICATION.md`](../PROMPT-VERIFICATION.md) §6 (Goal · Workflow · Proof · Gates · Rollout), [`.claude/skills/mde-writing-plans/SKILL.md`](../../../.claude/skills/mde-writing-plans/SKILL.md) (user stories + observable proof), and optionally [`.agents/skills/tasks-generator/SKILL.md`](../../../.agents/skills/tasks-generator/SKILL.md) (PRD → tasks).

| Layer | Intent |
|-------|--------|
| **Goal** | E8 multi-channel index: order and gates for WA v2 + OpenClaw. |
| **Workflow** | Use this file to sequence; don’t start 08B until ADRs closed. |
| **Proof** | Checklist: 08F + 08K + 05M green. |
| **Gates** | Conflicts with CORE 08L bridge resolved in planning. |
| **Rollout** | Roadmap only until gates green. |

## Subtasks (IDs map to E8-001…E8-004)

Lettered files **skip `08E`** in the basename so the epic index stays the only `08E-*.md` file (same pattern as [`05E`](05E-agent-infrastructure.md), [`07E`](07E-contract-automation.md)).

| ID | Was | File | Status |

**Audit (gaps → prompts):** [`tasks/audit/04-openclaw.md`](../audit/04-openclaw.md)

**Dependencies:** **08F** / **08K** first (architecture + provider — **no code blockers**). **[`05M-openclaw-gateway-health-stub.md`](prompts/advanced/openclaw/05M-openclaw-gateway-health-stub.md)** (E5-012) before public WA. **08B** requires **[`05H-openclaw-gateway-adapter.md`](prompts/advanced/openclaw/05H-openclaw-gateway-adapter.md)** (E5-007) + **08A** + **08F**; complete **[`08H`](prompts/advanced/whatsapp/08H-openclaw-wa-adapter-phase1.md)** before claiming full **08B**. **08G** with **08A**. **08C** requires **E2-001** (lead pipeline) + **08B**. **08D** requires **08B**. **08I** after **08H**. **08J** P3 after **08H**.

**Suggested order:** **08F** + **08K** → **08A** → **05M** → **05H** → **08H** → **08B** → **08G** (parallel) → **08C** & **08D** → **08I** → **08J** (optional).

## Verification

Infobip webhook + OpenClaw routing smoke tests; lead rows with `source: 'whatsapp'`; escalation path when confidence is below 0.3.
